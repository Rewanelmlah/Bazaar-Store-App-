##Bazaar: Store App.

I am pleased to introduce my latest creation: Bazaar, a sophisticated Store application is a Flutter-based application designed to deliver a seamless and dynamic shopping experience by leveraging API integrations. With its intuitive interface and robust functionality, the app offers users a comprehensive range of features to enhance their shopping journey.

This Store application showcases my expertise in fetching and displaying products from a real API using various Flutter packages. 

The app was developed using the following technologies:

• HTTP Package: Employed to fetch data from the API, ensuring real-time product updates.

• Cached Images: Integrated to optimize image loading and improve overall app performance.

• Future Builder: Utilized to create widgets dynamically based on the API response.

• API Requests: Implemented three distinct requests for fetching all products, all categories, and updated products.

• Reusable Components: Developed to ensure consistency and efficiency across the app's interface.

This project challenged me to apply and expand upon the knowledge gained from my previous app development experiences, resulting in a polished and functional Store App.
